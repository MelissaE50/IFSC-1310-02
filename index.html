    <h1>Thoughts on Web Accesssibility</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Web accessibility is everyone's responsibility. In the tangible world, we provide handicapped accessible spaces for folks in wheelchairs and adaptive learning methods for people with dyslexia. Why wouldn't we try our best to also provide accessibility to the web for those who need non-traditional access.</p>
  <blockquote>Doesn't necessarily provide an engaging or superior user experience, but helps ensure that people can <em>have</em> an experience in the first place. <cite>From Accessibility for the Modern Web by Derek Featherstone.</cite></blockquote>
  <p>When considering web accessibility, there are benefits across the board. Everyone should have equal access to information in a way that works best for them. Understanding what obstacles exist for people with disabilities is the first step. Some examples of accommodations include text for images for the visually impaired, video captioning for the hearing impaired, and keyboard navigation tools mobility or dexterity issues. Establishing these basic accommodations should be paramount in design. There are many more options that can be provided as additional needs are discovered.</p>
  <p>Beyond just the ethical and moral obligations to ensure that all users have access to websites, businesses benefit from making their sites user friendly for all visitors. Additionally, it is smart to provide potential customers with every tool they need to access your services and/or products. From a business perspective, showing that you care about your patrons is a good practice and encourages brand loyalty.</p>
