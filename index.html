    <h1>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Web accessibility is everyone's responsibility. In the tangible world, we provide handicapped accessible spaces for folks in wheelchairs and adaptive learning methods for people with dyslexia. Why wouldn't we try our best to also provide accessibility to the web for those who need non-traditional access.</p>
  <blockquote>Doesn't necessarily provide an engaging or superior user experience, but helps ensure that people can <em>have</em> an experience in the first place. <cite>From Accessibility for the Modern Web by Derek Featherstone.</cite></blockquote>
  <p>When considering web accessibility, there are benefits across the board. Everyone should have equal access to information in a way that works best for them. Understanding what obstacles exist for people with disabilities is the first step. Some examples of accommodations include text for images for the visually impaired, video captioning for the hearing impaired, and keyboard navigation tools mobility or dexterity issues. Establishing these basic accommodations should be paramount in design. There are many more options that can be provided as additional needs are discovered.</p>
  <p>Beyond just the ethical and moral obligations to ensure that all users have access to websites, businesses benefit from making their sites user friendly for all visitors. Additionally, it is smart to provide potential customers with every tool they need to access your services and/or products. From a business perspective, showing that you care about your patrons is a good practice and encourages brand loyalty.</p>
  <h1>Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is the concept of making core content efficient, accessible, and usable for everyone. The strategy behind progressive enhancement is to build it for an older browser and then make it fancier going up so that people with modern browsers will get an enhanced experience without taking away from the experience of older browser users. It is the counterpoint to graceful degradation which starts with a modern application but loses some of its high functionality as it adapts to older browsers. </p> Additional information about progressive enhancement can be found <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/progressive-enhancement/">here.</a></li>

  <h1>Project Reflection</h1>
<p>Working on the SpaceX website has been both fun and challenging. This project pulled together everything I have learned throughout the semester and gave me a chance to put it into practice. I came into this class with some programming knowledge and experience having taken Java, C++, and Python previously. I have used other IEDs like Visual Studio and Eclipse, but this was my first dive into using GitHub. I have to admit that I like GitHub, and I appreciate the opportunity to use this class as a gateway to building a GitHub portfolio.</p> 

<p>I have always been a fan of puzzles. I find that most programming tasks—at their base—are puzzles. Decomposing a problem and figuring out the best way to address it holds my attention. Learning a new language in programming is very similar to learning a new language linguistically. Once you understand a new programming language, you can communicate with the computer in a similar way that you’d communicate with a person who speaks a different language. Suddenly, you understand each other.</p>
    
<p>Learning HTML and CSS was a lot of fun but also frustrating at times. I appreciated the way this class was conducted where we really just dove into writing code almost right away. CodePen was really useful because I could see the changes happening in real time as I wrote code. That is definitely a tool I will keep in my toolbox going forward. I think I did better with HTML than I did with CSS overall. My interests, so far, have been more back end than front end. I like to build the bones, but I don’t know that I have a particular talent for making the bones into something pretty. That being said, I was surprised as I built up the SpaceX website that I enjoyed playing with the colors, typography, and widgets. I had fun looking for pictures to use and seeing how they worked against the backgrounds. I still need to practice a lot more with working on asides, flex, and border radius options. The only way to make learning stick is to keep doing it.</p>

<p>Accessibility was not something I had really ever given much thought to before this class. I am fortunate to not have any limitations in that regard. Understanding how adding text to images helps vision-impaired folks enjoy effective access to a website was definitely an eye-opener and something that I will carry with me as I navigate my place in the IT industry.</p>

<p>After a few family members viewed the first draft of the SpaceX Dragon website I created, I took note of the areas they found to be problematic. Words spilling to the very edge on the right and left side of the page was an issue. To correct this, I went into my CSS stylesheet and realized I hadn’t added styling for the content sections. I created the appropriate contents sections and renamed them for the various pages of the site, then added margins to them. Another complaint was that my weather widget for SpaceX looked odd set off to the left. I had included it inside the content section in my HTML, so I moved it into its own container and created styling for it in CSS to center it below the content section on the home page.</p>

<p>The table at the bottom of the history page wasn’t adequately spaced. I again went into my stylesheet and added padding to the <td> element to space things out in the tables. The last issue was that the content inside the three articles under “Configurations” on the home page weren’t symmetrical. The photos were showing up as different sizes. I tried resizing the photos but that didn’t fix the issue.</p>
  
<p>Overall, my experience in this class was great. I feel like I walked in with no knowledge of how to build a usable website, and I am leaving with the ability to build something basic that would be accessible to everyone.</p>
